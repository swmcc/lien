## Description

Lives in the ☁️ and 💾 my 📙's  

### Premise

I find bookmarks a handy tool. However finding a tool that meets my requirements
has proven to be very difficult. 

#### Requirements

- Saves the link with a title.
- Tagging enabled
- Searching
- No adverts
- Can be used from several devices
- Can be used from the command line

I used to use [del.icio.us](delicious.com) but that got sold to
[yahoo](Yahoo) - enough said. [Google Bookmarks](https://www.google.co.uk/bookmarks/)
doesn't suit me as I can be on different accounts (work, personal). So instead
of subscribing to a third party and have them either 'sunset' the app after a few years
I have decided to write my own.

## Disclaimer

This app is only meant for me. It doesn't do multi user. PR's are welcome if you 
want to change this.
